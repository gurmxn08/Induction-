# Induction-
# Day 1 at Gndec college 
My first day at college was on 31st July 2025. The students of CSE and IT all gathered at the college Gurudwara Sahib at 8:30 a.m. With the blessings of God, we started our first day at college. Inside the Gurudwara Sahib, it felt like we were inside the ship (Jawaj) of God. After the Shabad Kirtan, refreshments were arranged for us.
