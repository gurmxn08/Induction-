# Induction
# Day 1 at Gndec college 
- My first day at college was on 31st July 2025. The students of CSE and IT all gathered at the college Gurudwara Sahib at 8:30 a.m. With the blessings of God, we started our first day at college. Inside the Gurudwara Sahib, it felt like we were inside the ship (Jawaj) of God. After the Shabad Kirtan, refreshments were arranged for us.
 
- After that, we were addressed by the Principal and the Dean of Academics. We were introduced to various departments, faculty members, and staff. They gave us an overview of GNDEC's history, vision, and mission. Talks by alumni were shared with us through videos.
  
- Then we visited our branch building, where we interacted with our teachers. They informed us about our branch, gave us a campus tour, and showed us the labs along with many other important facilities.

- Overall, the day helped me feel more connected to the college and confident about the journey ahead. I’m looking forward to the next day’s activities.
 # Day 2 at Gndec college 
 - The second day of the induction program at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) was held on 1st August (Friday). I was genuinely excited about the day's activities.

- The day began at 9:30 AM with an English Proficiency test conducted by our seniors. This test aimed to assess our basic command of the English language and lasted for one hour. Immediately following this, there was a Mathematics Proficiency Test, which continued until 11:30 AM. Both assessments were well-organized by the college.

- After the tests, we were given a break, during which I took the opportunity to explore the campus. The campus environment was vibrant, and I enjoyed discovering the infrastructure and layout of the institution.

- At 1:00 PM, all students from the CSE and IT branches assembled in the college auditorium. A highly informative session was conducted by Dr. Arashdeep Singh on the topic of food and nutrition. He enlightened us on the importance of healthy eating habits and shared valuable information regarding food awareness. His insights were engaging and relevant, making the session both interesting and beneficial.

- Following this, there was another session conducted by our seniors, where they introduced us to the Causmic Club—a student-driven initiative founded by our seniors. They explained the purpose of the club, its activities, and how it helps students grow both academically and personally. They also shared their own experiences of being part of the club and how it positively impacted their college journey. This session was particularly motivating and gave us a sense of belonging and direction.

- Overall, the second day of the induction program was highly informative. As newcomers, we were able to learn a lot about the campus, the academic culture and extracurricular opportuitiees available to us.
# Day 3 at Gndec college 
- The third day at GNDEC College, which was on August 2nd (Saturday), was quite engaging and informative. I was informed to report to the college by 9:00 AM. Upon arrival, we attended a session in the auditorium conducted by Dr. Jaswinder Singh. His session turned out to be extremely interesting, and I personally enjoyed it a lot. He shared his life experiences with us. Dr. Singh interacted with many students during the talk and provided us with valuable insights related to science and mathematics, but more importantly, about life itself. His words were not only educational but also thought-provoking. He truly is a brilliant and inspiring teacher.

- Following that, at 11:00 AM, we had another session led by Dr. Priya Darshni Madam, which focused on human rights. She shared her thoughts on the idea of the continuity of happiness. What made her session particularly engaging was the way she encouraged student interaction by asking for our opinions. This created an open and lively discussion. She also invited questions from the audience and answered them thoughtfully and clearly.
