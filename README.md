# Induction-
# Day 1 at Gndec college 
- My first day at college was on 31st July 2025. The students of CSE and IT all gathered at the college Gurudwara Sahib at 8:30 a.m. With the blessings of God, we started our first day at college. Inside the Gurudwara Sahib, it felt like we were inside the ship (Jawaj) of God. After the Shabad Kirtan, refreshments were arranged for us.
 
- After that, we were addressed by the Principal and the Dean of Academics. We were introduced to various departments, faculty members, and staff. They gave us an overview of GNDEC's history, vision, and mission. Talks by alumni were shared with us through videos.
  
- Then we visited our branch building, where we interacted with our teachers. They informed us about our branch, gave us a campus tour, and showed us the labs along with many other important facilities.

- Overall, the day helped me feel more connected to the college and confident about the journey ahead. I’m looking forward to the next day’s activities.
